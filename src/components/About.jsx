                            <p>I&apos;m a frontend developer who sees the world through the lens of design. With a range of experience from customer support to leading cross-functional teams supporting innovation and product improvements, I feel that I bring value to an employer in my ability to create trusting relationships both internally and with clients. For me, this is the foundation for creating real value for customers and the company I work with.</p>
