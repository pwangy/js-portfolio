				I&apos;m a frontend developer who sees the world through the
				lens of design. With a range of experience from customer support
				to leading cross-functional teams supporting innovation and
				product improvements, I feel that I bring value to an employer
				in my ability to create trusting relationships both internally
				and with clients. For me, this is the foundation for creating
				real value for customers and the company I work with.
